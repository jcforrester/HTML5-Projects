00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
President Whitmore: Good Morning

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In less than an hour, aircraft from here will join others from around the world.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Mankind,

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That word should have new meaning for all of us today.

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. 

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We will be united in our common interests.

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Perhaps it's fate that today is the Fourth of July,

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and you will once again be fighting for our freedom.

10
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution.

11
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but from annihilation.

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We are fighting for our right to live. To exist.

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And should we win the day,

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday,

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but as the day the world declared in one voice:

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We will not go quietly into the night!

17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We will not vanish without a fight!

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We're going to live on!

19
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.000
We're going to survive!

20
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Today we celebrate our Independence Day!
